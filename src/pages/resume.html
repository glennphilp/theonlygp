              <p>The first six months of being contracted at UT&nbsp;Southwestern I quickly realized the complexities that faced a very diverse development group. It was during this time I began researching and planning the future of what would become UT&nbsp;Southwestern's flavor of Foundation by Zurb - an adaptive-responsive framework that would work in outdated browsers, while providing the flexibility for modern development.</p>

              <p>Praxis was a medical billing start-up in Oklahoma City. While working here I wore many hats from providing ideas for new brand design and assisting oversight for the outsourced company website, in addition to supporting systems with servers and setting up workstations, and billing data entry when the start-up was short-staffed.</p>

              <p>As a digital specialist it was my goal to provide a living for myself and family, which meant I wore many hats. If a client wanted SEO analysis, done. If they needed a marketing email, done. If their web site was down I discovered the reason and solved, done. Being a freelancer isn't all about the customer though, there is marketing yourself, paying taxes, budgeting and saving for future growth, task management, etc.</p>
